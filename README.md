Explanation of task

Toggle Switch:
A toggle switch is a graphical control element that allows users to switch between two states, usually "on" and "off" or "enabled" and "disabled".
It consists of a lever or button that can be moved or clicked to change its state.
In web development, toggle switches are often used in user interfaces to enable or disable certain features or settings.
In the provided code, the toggle switch is implemented using HTML and CSS to visually represent two states (light and dark mode), and JavaScript may be used to handle the state changes and perform corresponding actions.

Sign Up / Sign In User Task:
The sign-up and sign-in tasks are common actions in web applications that allow users to create new accounts (sign-up) or log in to existing accounts (sign-in).
The sign-up process typically involves users providing necessary information such as username, email, and password to create a new account.
The sign-in process requires users to enter their credentials (usually username/email and password) to authenticate and gain access to their accounts.
These tasks are essential for user authentication and access control in web applications, ensuring that users have personalized experiences and secure access to their data.
In the provided code, sign-up and sign-in functionality may be implemented using forms for user input, client-side and server-side validation, and authentication mechanisms to manage user accounts securely. JavaScript and server-side programming languages such as Node.js may be used to handle form submissions, validate user input, and interact with databases to store and retrieve user information.# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
